Quick Literature Review
-----------------------

**Clustering of time series data - a survey** provided an overview of time-series-clustering, and then grouped into three major methods. - raw-data-based approaches (high dimension spaces) - feature-based approaches (manual feature and dimension reduction methods) - model-based approaches

Including Research Code and Data
--------------------------------

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
load("../data/hs300.RData")
source("TSClustering.R")
```
